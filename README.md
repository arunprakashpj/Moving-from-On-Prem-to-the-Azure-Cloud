# Moving-from-On-Prem-to-the-Azure-Cloud

## Project-Overview  
This project focuses on migrating an on-premises environment to Azure Cloud. It includes assessing the current environment, designing cost-effective solutions, and implementing scalability, backup, recovery, and security configurations in Azure Cloud.

---

## Objectives  

### 1. Assessing-the-On-Premises-Environment  
- Inventory all on-premises systems, applications, and dependencies.  
- Map equivalent Azure services for migration.  
- Identify services and firewall exceptions to carry forward.  

### 2. Cost-Estimates  
- Evaluate the feasibility of high availability (HA) and disaster recovery (DR) in Azure.  
- Research the scalability of deployed Azure VMs.  
- Conduct a cost analysis for migration and ongoing cloud operations.  

### 3. Additional-WordPress-Server-Deployment  
- Compare ARM templates with traditional server images for deployment.  
- Replicate the on-prem WordPress server configuration in Azure.  
- Perform a cost/benefit analysis of using ARM templates for deployment.  

### 4. Backup-and-Recovery  
- Contrast Restore Time Objective (RTO) and Restore Point Objective (RPO).  
- Back up all Azure cloud VMs.  
- Compare Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery.  

### 5. Antivirus-Communication  
- Configure Network Security Groups (NSGs) to allow traffic from the antivirus server.  
- Analyze and implement necessary inbound port exceptions for Windows OS.
